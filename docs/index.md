## __Abstract__
In recent years, liver cancer has become the third leading cause of cancer deaths, and the vast majority of liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib is the first-line systemic therapy for the advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, numerous patients respond poorly to sorafenib or develop resistance after months of treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore the underlying mechanism of sorafenib resistance. By constructing HepG2 sorafenib resistant cell line and performing RNA sequencing, our study identified that KDELR3 could promote HCC sorafenib resistance by inhibiting ferroptosis. Therefore, targeting KDELR3 may offer a potential combination strategy to reduce sorafenib resistance in HCC.
